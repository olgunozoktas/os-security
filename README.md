# Assigment 1 - Caesar Cipher
The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

# Assigment 2 - Frequency Analysis
Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are the most common, while Z, Q and X are rare. Likewise, TH, ER, ON, and AN are the most common pairs of letters (termed bigrams or digraphs), and SS, EE, TT, and FF are the most common repeats.[1] The nonsense phrase "ETAOIN SHRDLU" represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical English language text.

# Assigment 3 - Prime Number Checker
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.

Write a program that get input from user than show how many iteration need to find out if number is prime or not. If number is not prime you should give factorials of given number.   

Method I: Should use regular calculation method. It should divide every positive number available between 1 and less than given value itself ( 1 < divider < n)

Method II: Should use algorithm that was mentioned below.

𝑏 ← 𝑛 , 𝑥 ← 𝑛, 𝑖 ← 2
while x > 1 and i ≤ b do
while i divides x do
print i
𝑥 ← 𝑥/𝑖
𝑏 ← 𝑥
end while
𝑖 ← 𝑖 + 1
end while
if x> 1 then print x

# Assigment 4 - Sieve of Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes is simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. Write application that ask upper limit as n and use this ancient algorithm to print all available prime numbers from 2 to n.

# Assigment 5 - Self Signed Certificate
In cryptography and computer security, a self-signed certificate is an identity certificate that is signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies. This term has nothing to do with the identity of the person or organization that actually performed the signing procedure.
